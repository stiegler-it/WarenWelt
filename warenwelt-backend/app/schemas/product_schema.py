# If not using computed_field, the transformation would typically happen in the service/router
# when preparing the response. For now, we'll add a placeholder and expect the router to fill it,
# or let the frontend prepend its known API base.
# A simpler approach for ProductRead is to just include image_url and let client handle it.
# Let's revert full_image_url for now and ensure image_url is present.
# The ProductBase already has image_url: Optional[str]
# So ProductRead will also have it.

# The API endpoint will return the relative image_url. The frontend knows the base URL.
# The image_upload_util.py saves to "static/product_images/..."
# The Product model stores "product_images/..."
# FastAPI serves "/static/product_images/..."
# Frontend requests "BACKEND_URL/static/product_images/..."
# This seems consistent. No need for full_image_url in the schema itself if frontend handles prefix.
